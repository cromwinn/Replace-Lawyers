This app is intended to replace the entire legal profession. To do so, the app will first be trained on actual student exams and coursework at Yale Law school, and be required to pass the bar examination in the relevant legal domains. It will then pass through an integration phase, where experienced lawyers "teach" the app best practices in the industry. The app will eventually be supported by a team of human negotiators and interactors to maanage the client business interactions.
